		"description":"* by Wormath Splathershed * \n\nFoundation of the Forgotten Kingdom (year 2300)\nThe first humans, led by Arntuk the Mighty, came from the south in ancient times and established the Forgotten Kingdom. These people called the Lethgar built settlements at places where nowadays, great towns and cities are located.  Nor City and Sullengard were the first to be founded.\nThen some time later, a few explorers climbed Mount Galmore, the highest mountain in Dhayavar. Due to the elevation and marvelous view, their priests and mages built a sanctuary near the summit where they studied the arts of magic and worshipped their gods. \n\nRise of Kazaul (year 2177)\nThe insane and powerful wizard called Valugha was obsessed with the notion of creating a portal to another plane. Even though his fellow mages disapproved, he was able to create a portal by consuming the powerful life essence of his brothers and the stored energy in the sanctuary. The sanctuary erupted in an explosion and a large ravine cut Mt. Galmore apart. At its bottom, the portal opened which was soon merely called the 'Rift' and the devastated area around it 'Undertell'. Besides the mountain spilled out lava like blood coming from a wound and is now clouded in smoke all the time.\nThrough the portal, all kinds of demons and undead (Kazaul, Allaceph, Skeletons, Ghosts and Spirits like the Hirathil, Ash and Fire spawns) emerged into the world, led by their masters, the 'Kazaul'. The Kazaul themselves were guided by the Eternal Masters who were incredibly skilled in magic and warcraft. Soon the monsters and their masters spread over whole Dhayavar. However the portal became unstable after a while and finally deactivated after several decades but the harm was already done as thousands of beasts had crept through it into the realm. \nA short and brutal war was fought. With the loss of nearly all mages, the Lethgar were powerless against the monster invasion and were soon overthrown and enslaved by the Kazaul. The Kazaul imposed a reign of terror on the Forgotten Kingdom. It seemed no one was able to defeat or oppose the Kazaul due to their inhuman strength. \nThen the Lethgar had to build underground lairs for their oppressors. A large city was built around the deactivated portal and in the natural caves under Mt. Galmore. Besides Carn Tower and the Sanctuary on Blackwater Mountain were built, among countless other underground Kazaul settlements.\nEven though most Lethgar despised their masters, some showed interest in the rituals and dark sorcery (necromancy, summoning of demons, ...) of Kazaul. As a result, the Kha'zaan (Kazaul cultists), a group of human Kazaul followers, gathered around their masters and learned from them. They were often used to enforce the brutal rule of Kazaul. Many of the current monsters are living forms that evolved from experiments made during this era (the so named constructs and giants): Izthiels, Gornauds, Dragons and Wyrms, Khakin beasts, Gargoyles and Zombies, Trolls and Giants, Irdeghs, Basilisks, Redfoots beasts, Mazarths, Jellies. Zortaks and goblins are of another origin for example.\nBy that time, the Hira'zinn, the omen of war, started plaguing the smallfolk. \n\nThe War of Dawn and the Rise of Elythara and the Elytharan Union (year 1537)\nOne day, the Elytharan cultists arrived on the shore of the northern sea (Sea of Tears). They worshipped the blinding and cleansing light of Elythara. \nThe Elytharan mages and warriors were able to defeat the Kazaul and Kha'zaan with the help of the blinding light of Elythara which was forged into their weapons. The Kazaul were almost reduced to nothing because their Eternal Masters were slain. However she and her cultists failed at completely annihilating them, as few Kazaul and followers managed to hide in remote places in the total darkness, unknown to the Elytharans. This is explained by the fact that Kazaul's dark spells were powerless against the blinding light of Elythara but instead Elythara's power is diminished deep underground (Mt. Galmore and other sanctuaries) in the total darkness.  But still, for hundreds of years, the Kazaul hibernated in the darkness.  \nThe visual appearance of her powers, as well as her perceived benevolence towards the commoners lead to people to call her the Goddess of Light. People were overjoyed about the defeat of Kazaul.  The Elytharans helped the people organize life and built several towns and cities, dedicated to their goddess. Several aristocratic houses were formed by that time. Each city was ruled by one or two houses who closely collaborated with the Elytharan priests.\nA long era of peace and prosperity followed and the Elytharan Union was founded, to spread the word of Elythara over the whole realm. Even though the aristocrats ruled the cities, people were majorly influenced by the Elytharan priests.\nObviously, the world under Elythara isn't all unicorns and rainbows, although that's what her priests want us to believe. Her 'light' was shown to those who refused to follow the 'right' way, generally leaving them blind or worse... (I think of this era as a blend between enlightenment and inquisition. If you're part of the group, this is a pretty prosperous era of philosophy and trade. If you aren't, this is just another form of oppression.)\n The Elytharans soon began erecting the city of Feygard at the shore of the Sea of Tears which soon became a center of trade for the realm due to the access to the sea. \nThe town of Loneford was founded and it soon became famous for its fertile fields and healthy cattle which fed  the northern parts of the Forgotten Kingdom. \nBlackwater Mountain was explored and on its summit, a large sanctuary for the Elytharan priests was erected, to study dawn and dusk, sun and stars and to watch over the Forgotten Kingdom. Other sanctuaries were located in Feygard, Nor City and shrines were found in each minor settlement. Besides the mining colony of Prim was founded after pioneers had found rich sources of iron and coal under the mountain.\nThe city of Fallhaven became a prospering centre of trade due to its excellent location as a knot between the sanctuary of Blackwater Mountain, Stoutford, Nor City and Feygard. Most of the traffic sooner or later passed Fallhaven so the city became one of the richest in no time. Big storehouses were built to offer safely store shipments. However, bands of thieves were soon attracted by the growing wealth and united under one big organization, the Thieves' Guild whose guild halls were secretly placed in Fallhaven, Feygard and Nor City being the richest cities by that time. \nThalgard and Brightport were founded as well.\nVilegard and Stoutford werefounded.\nBrimhaven was founded.\nThe Charwood mines were opened.\nTrade agreements were signed between the cities in order to make trade prosper further. \n\nEstablishment of the Aewatha Kingdom (year 432)\nThe head of the most important Nor City family, Garthan I of house Houdart, declared himself King, marking the end of the Elytharan era and the beginning of the Shadow-supported kingdom. At this point, political power and religious power became closely united. As the kingdom prospered, so did the Shadow, and Elythara was quickly forgotten by almost everyone in a handful of generations. A large temple complex with a magnificent cathedral was built in the center of Nor City where the former shrines of Elythara had been located. Smaller churches were built across the country. People now commonly believed in the Shadow.\nGarthan I ordered the exploration of the dreaded Mt. Galmore and a large mine was opened for a few decades where gems and gold were found in abundance.  Any remaining Elytharan followers were used as slaves for the digging. At that time the Flagstone Prison was also built, where runaway workers from Mt. Galmore were imprisoned and were left to rot. However the mines were closed after some years due to frequent monster attacks and other unspeakable horrors who dwelt in the dark.\nRemgard was founded by Korhald of Remgard and built on a large island on Lake Laeroth. It became famous for its excellent smithing services. \nLuthaven was founded.\nThe village of Crossglen was founded. Farmers and ranchers settled there.\nKing Luthor climbed the throne as the direct heir of King Oromir III and moved the capital from Nor City to Fallhaven while the center of worship remained in Nor City. As King Luthor got older he  felt the need of an advisor and so, Lord Geomyr of Feygard was named Hand of the King. He fulfilled his duty with great obsession and effort. \n\nThe Noble Wars (year 25 to 14)\nWhen King Luthor died, he left the Kingdom with no heir to the throne. He was buried in the catacombs under Fallhaven church. What followed, would write history as the Noble Wars, one of the darkest periods this country has witnessed. \nFour coalitions were formed which were each ruled by one powerful Lord: the Western one consisted of Stoutford and the settlements on Blackwater Mountain (Lord Erwyn). The Northern one consisted of Feygard, Thalgard, Luthaven and Remgard (Lord Geomyr). The Eastern one consisted of Nor City, Sullengard, Brightport and Brimhaven (Lord Emeric). The center capital area first remained neutral and consisted of Fallhaven, Vilegard and Loneford (formerly administrated by King Luthor).\nThe Noble Wars started with the Land Lords arguing about the new, legimitate King. The first stone was thrown by Stoutford. Lord Erwyn tried to use the time to attack the center area when all the other Lords were busy with debating. He wanted to occupy those to control the trade routes of the Kingdom of Nor, to gain the biggest influence in the country and to separate all other coalitions. Fallhaven was partially destroyed.\nErwyn's success was a short one, as he was attacked by the Eastern coalition. For several years, numerous battles and countless skirmishes were fought over the control of the center area. When both Lords were weakened, Lord Geomyr attacked and forced both to surrender. He had had the biggest army from the start. The peace treaty of Fallhaven was signed and Lord Geomyr was proclaimed King.\nThe Hira'zinn haunted the lands during the war again. \n\nThe Rule of King Geomyr (year 14)\nKing Geomyr urged to restore the destroyed cities and remove the traces of the long war. He reinstalled a tax system and garrisons of the Royal Guard of Feygard to most of the villages. Geomyr promoted nepotism and corruption to further increase his power.\nThe cult of the Shadow became ever more important for the smallfolk. The commoners  felt the need for salvation after the harsh period of the Noble Wars and accepted the Shadow as their guide into better times.\nLord Geomyr became jealous about the power of the religion and tensions between Nor City and Feygard started to rise. He then proclaimed the prohibitions against the cult. They were no longer allowed to perform their rituals (necromancy) and he tried to detain some of the priests. \nThen he even banned the trade and use of heartsteel weapons (three years ago) as he feared they would be used to overthrow him.  He destroyed many weapons and confiscated others. Bonemeal potions were prohibited as well much to the disapproval of the smallfolk and the priests.\nAs a result, the priests forged secret plans to overthrow Lord Geomyr. They even revived King Luthor with necromancy, as they think he is the better King."
